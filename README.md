# Reverse Engineering Castle.io Antibot

## ðŸ“– About the Project

This project aims to reverse engineer the Castle.io antibot system. I first encountered this system on Coinbase and decided to explore it further by testing it on Rockstar Games. In my blog post, I share the techniques I learned and the results I obtained throughout the process.

In the blog, I cover code reviews, the token generation process, and the obfuscation techniques used. This project contains the necessary information and methods to bypass the Castle.io antibot system.
